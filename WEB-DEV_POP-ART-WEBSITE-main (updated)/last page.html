          “Working on CTRL+ALT+POP was such a learning experience. As someone who is very new to web development, it was interesting to learn how planning, designing, and collaborating with your fellow peers can be very important in creating a website. CTRL+ALT+POP is the proof of me and my peer's teamwork and collaboration—showing us how important it is to communicate one's ideas in order to create something, like this website, more efficiently.”

The key takeaway I realized from doing this website is how important good teamwork and communicating your ideas to each other is, as it allowed a proper flow of information within the group.”
